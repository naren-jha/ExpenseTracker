# Question

## Expense tracker

Design a system that allows for the addition of expenses and split the same among multiple users or within a group.

Mandatory Requirements:
* Create a group. A group can contain two or more users.
* Split expenses between users( they may not be a part of a group) or in a group.
* The strategy of splitting the amount should be extensible. You can implement equal splitting.
* Able to see the pending credit or pending debit in a group or between users. (Let's say between A and B who is going to pay which user and the amount)
* Can view the transaction details ( All the expenses which got added) in a group or peer-to-peer.

Bonus points:
Simplify debts ( Letâ€™s say A has to pay 30 to B, B has to pay 30 to C, then in simplify debt view, A has to pay 30 to C directly instead of B ).

Guidelines:
* Use any IDE
* Write a driver class for demo purposes. Which will execute all the commands in one place in the code and have test cases.
* You can print the output in the console. Do not create any UI for the application.
* Please prioritize code compilation, execution, and completion
* Work on the expected output first and then add bonus features last.

Expectations:
* Your code should cover all the mandatory functionalities explained above.
* Your code should be executable and clean.
* Your code should be properly refactored, and exceptions should be gracefully handled.
* Please add any assumptions taken in a README file.

How will you be evaluated?
* Code should be working.
* Code readability and testability
* Separation Of Concerns
* Object-Oriented concepts.
* Language proficiency.
* Scalability
* Test Coverage
* Concurrency handling(Bonus Points)
* [execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)
